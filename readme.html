<h1>Theme Documentation for Holding Pattern</h1>

<p class="intro">Holding Pattern is a very simple and easy-to-use landing page theme that allows you to quickly customize your landing page with your company logo, a custom background image and color, and allow people to subscribe to your feedburner feed either by RSS or email, if desired.</p>

<h2>Customizing Holding Pattern</h2>

<p>Customizing this theme is extremely easy.</p>

<p>Simply go over to the <a href="admin.php?page=upthemes#/colors">Colors & Images</a> page to get started. From there you will be able to upload images to the theme to customize its appearance.</p>

<p>Once you've uploaded images and set background colors, go ahead and set up your <a href="admin.php?page=upthemes#/layout">Layout & Display</a> options, as well as your <a href="admin.php?page=upthemes#/general">General</a> options as well, which contains the message that will be displayed to your visitors.</p>
